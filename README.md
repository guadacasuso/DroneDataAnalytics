This is my work on some Drone Data Processing and Visualization Samples

**First question to answer will be:**
How many drones do I need in a fleet to accomplish a mission? 
A mission can be a fire rescue, a monitoring service, an agriculture scenario, etc 

My Datasources will be the Flight Data that is attached and also I will need to add some other measurements such as Batery and Sensors operation.  
For weather I will use Accuweather http://apidev.accuweather.com/developers/
