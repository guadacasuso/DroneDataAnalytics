Some Drone Data Processing and Visualization Samples

**Hypotesis:** 
In any autonomous flight mission, the number of UAVs needed to accomplish a mission is very important in order to keep SLA of the Service. 
As an example, think about Fire Rescue: several considerations need to be taken to define the right number of units that can perform de Job. 
Environmental conditions such as Weather, Season, Territory coverage extension, Altitude, Closeness to the water 
Drone Data: Batery Capacity, Sensors Information, etc  

**First question to answer will be:**
How many drones do I need in a fleet to accomplish a mission? 
A mission can be a fire rescue, a monitoring service, an agriculture scenario, etc 

**My Datasources will be:**
The Flight Data that is [here] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guadacasuso/DroneDataAnalytics/master/Data/flight_data.csv)  and also I will need to add some other measurements such as Battery and Sensors operation. 

For weather I will use the Accuweather Public Datasource https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/

**Challenges and successes** 


**Business Impact**
The mail goal of this project is to be able to achieve efficiency in the use of drones 
In terms of potentiality I see the possibility of: 
- Analizing sensors performance and improve batteries development/usage (For Manufacturers) 
- Track Drones components life and improve (For Manufacturers) 
- ReStock of drones


**Conclusions and Key Learnings**
